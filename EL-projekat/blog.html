<p class="text-light">At last, we’ve reached the finish line! That’s right, folks … today, I’m releasing Broken<br> People, the final book in the epic Broken Nature trilogy.</p>
<p class="text-light">Long ago, the mysterious Broken Apocalypse ravaged Earth, drying up its surface<br> water and reducing its soil to dust. Billions perished of thirst …</p>
<p class="text-light">Broken Nature is an action-packed, post-apocalyptic series, one that revolves around<br> the mind-boggling disappearance of Earth’s surface water. It stars two very different<br> people—Titus Foster and Kayden Kell—as they fight to fix a very broken nature. No<br> spoilers here, but this final book is truly awesome. You’re going to love how it ends!</p>
<p class="text-light">If you haven’t tried the series yet, you’re in luck. Starting today, the Broken Lands ebook<br> is on-sale for just $0.99! But act fast, because that price won’t last long.</p>
<p class="text-light">Your copy of Broken People is just moments away. Click anywhere you see the title or<br> cover to purchase the ebook or paperback from Amazon!</p>

        <h1 class="text-decoration-underline pt-5">The Reason for God</h1>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 text-start">
        <p class="pt-5 pb-3 text-light">Over the last week, I’ve been consuming books by former Presbyterian pastor, Timothy Keller. Partly because my WIP is about the Garden of Eden. But mostly for personal reasons. My father-in-law, Richard Platt, passed away on Saturday, after a long battle with a veritable mountain of ailments. And so, I’ve found myself thinking a lot about the subject of death as well as about what lies ahead of us.</p>
        <p class="pb-3 text-light">I came to Timothy while watching a sermon from now-former pastor and family friend, Pete James. Pete mentioned three favorite authors, with C.S. Lewis and Timothy Keller being two of them (the third one escapes my memory). So, I watched one of Timothy’s sermons on YouTube (The Wounded Spirit) and was blown away by it. Right away, I bought his first book, The Reason for God.</p>
        <p class="pb-3 text-light">Suffice it to say, it was truly eye-opening. I thought I understood Christianity before this, but nope. Not even close. Rather, my views were similar to those of the Pharisees. That is, people should, by and large, avoid sin and attempt to live as morally as possible. Which, to my astonishment, was utterly wrong. Even my working definition of “sin” was wrong. So, yeah … I’ve got a lot of soul-searching to do. Perhaps strange to say, but I’m excited about it!</p>

        <h1 class="text-decoration-underline pt-5">Cy Reed Progress Report</h1>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 text-start">
            <p class="text-light pt-5 pb-3">  I’m now on draft #3 of my current Cy Reed book, tentatively entitled, Curse of Eden. I have no idea if that title will stick. Probably not. I tend to pick out the title right at the end of a story, not at the beginning.</p>
              <p class="text-light pb-3">So, you can probably guess that this story has something to do with the Garden of Eden. Originally, it started out as a book about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. I’d planned to incorporate some of the amazing research done by Stephanie Dalley in her book, The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: An Elusive World Wonder Traced. But as I ventured deeper into the story, I found my vision of the garden changing until it became the Garden of Eden.</p>
                <p class="text-light pb-3"> I’m roughly a third of the way through this draft. The story is still taking shape on the page, although I think I see where it’s going. I’m hoping to have it finished up by the end of the month!</p>

<div class="Facebook pt-5 pb-5">
    <div class="container text-center">
        <h1 class="text-decoration-underline pt-5">Banned from Facebook?</h1>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 text-start">
            <p class="text-light pt-5 pb-3"> Last night, Facebook unpublished my author page, claiming that it went “against our community standards.” Needless to say, I was flabbergasted. What did me in? Was it my weekly Work-in-Progress excerpt? Or perhaps it was my occasional thoughts on the writing process? I didn’t know and they wouldn’t tell me.</p> 
               <p class="text-light pb-3">I understand that Facebook has been under a lot of pressure to police content. Even so, I was caught by surprise. After all, I don’t talk about politics or sex and I don’t use profanity. My page is about my writing and my life, period. I can only assume that a bot mistagged my content. Regardless, I was unable to request a formal review of the decision, with Facebook explaining that it has “fewer reviewers right now because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.” All I could do was register my “disagreement” with the decision.</p>
               <p class="text-light pb-3">This story has a happy-ish ending. In the dead of night, Facebook reinstated my author page. No explanation, though. Just a note telling me it had been published again after a review of my “appeal.” I suppose I feel fortunate. In researching this issue, I came across lots of stories from people who’d lost their Facebook page and never gotten it back.</p>
               <p class="text-light pb-3">Truthfully, I don’t have a big Facebook audience. Plus, Facebook deliberately limits my reach, requiring one to pay up in order to reach a larger percentage of one’s own fans. So, my engagement tends to be rather limited. If I had lost the page, I doubt it would’ve hurt me much. </p>
                <p class="text-light pb-3">As of late, some of my author friends and I have been discussing the peril of building our platforms on third-party sites. Frequent rule changes and rising ad costs are often cited as key problems. I guess I can now add the risk of accidental deplatforming to the list. All in all, I don’t see much point in building something that could be taken from me at any time. I’ll continue to cross-post on Facebook for the time being. But going forward, I’ll be putting more of my effort into this website as well as into my newsletter.</p>
